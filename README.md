### calx

A calendar that shows full weeks of days.

Similar to the Unix [cal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_(Unix)) command.

Differences from `cal`:
- Display for each month shows the full week of days (showing days from prior or next month to fill out the listing)
- Display for a year of months is linear (not in a 3-up table)


Example:

$ calx 12 2016

       December 2016
    Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
    27 28 29 30  1  2  3
     4  5  6  7  8  9 10
    11 12 13 14 15 16 17
    18 19 20 21 22 23 24
    25 26 27 28 29 30 31
